a.out  -- will be final executable 
impl1.cpp -- one variant of copy checker function
impl1.o  -- object code for the first variant 
impl2.cpp  -- second variant of copy checker function
impl2.o  --- object code for the second variant
main.cpp -- main file in which a call to copy checker function is made
main.o -- object code for main file
reusable.cpp -- code that is reusable in both varinats: impl1.cpp and impl2.cpp
similarity.h -- has just  the prototype declaration of copychecker function


    we make sure that the delcaration used in main and variant bodies
  is exactly the same --> through .h file


     .h ----> used in main.cpp
         ----> defined in imple1.cpp  and imple2.cpp

    reusable.cpp --> used in imple1.cpp and impl2.cpp



how to compile?

  g++ -c main.cpp
  g++ -c imple1.cpp
  g++ main.o imple1.o -o build1 ==> a.out ==> run it  (build1)


  g++ -c imple2.cpp
  g++ main.o imple2.o -o build2 ==> a.out ==> run it  (build2)

 without -o name, it will produce a.out
